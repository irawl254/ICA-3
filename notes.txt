HTML- I have really enjoyed getting back in to HTML. I remember learning it in High School and really loving it, I just never put in the time to keep it up after my class was over. Fond memories of that class are what made me want to take this class and learn more! I love that it's a balance of problem solving, but that there are also tons of resources so I don't have to feel stuck for too long. I'm learning and re-learning slower than I'd like, but I'm learning slow and steady. I'm hoping this time through I'll remember what I learn so that I can use it more!
CSS- I think CSS is (and always has been) my favorite part of this kind of coding. I love colors and design, but don't always feel confident in my ability to create art from scratch. Websites give me a purpose to design, and then writing the code is like solving a puzzle to make things match my creative vision. I'm always suprised at just how much I am able to do, and how many design options there are.
GIT- I'm not going to lie, the concept of GIT makes sense but the execution still confuses me quite a bit. I talked to my dad today and he said he uses GIT every day, which has helped motivate me even though I don't quite understand everything. I'm hoping that we use it more in class so that I can practice and get more used to it. It's the first thing in this class that has been completely brand new, but the concept makes sense and I can see why it is used so frequently!

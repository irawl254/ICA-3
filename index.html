        <p>Finding Nemo is an under-the-sea adventure following Clownfish Marlin and his son Nemo. When Nemo is captured by humans, Marlin goes on a journey to find him and reunite their family. Along the way he meets Dory, and with the help of her stellar memory they navigate the ocean. We also see Nemo grow more confident as he learns from and becomes friends with fish living in a dentists office. </p>
